# Overall Conclusion

Based on the analysis above, we can conclude for both binary and continuous treatments:

## Binary Treatment

1. ✅ The batch-then-permute approach is faster than standard methods.
2. ✅ The batch-then-permute approach achieves lower error than standard methods.
3. ✅ The batch-then-permute approach scales better with sample size.

## Continuous Treatment

1. ❌ The batch-then-permute approach is not faster than standard methods.
2. ❌ The batch-then-permute approach does not achieve lower error than standard methods.

## Overall Recommendation

### Binary Treatment

Based on the efficiency metric (RMSE/Time), the **standard methods** provide the best trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.

### Continuous Treatment

Based on the efficiency metric (RMSE/Time), the **standard methods** provide the best trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency.

## Theoretical Implications

Per section 4.4 of the paper (Work Complexity for Large-Scale Learning), the theoretical expectation is that:

1. Standard methods: Time complexity should scale as O(n·log(1/ε))
2. Stochastic methods: Time complexity should scale as O(1/ε), independent of n

Empirical time complexity for standard methods (binary): O(n^0.50)
Empirical time complexity for SGD methods (binary): O(n^0.94)

Empirical time complexity for standard methods (continuous): O(n^0.68)
Empirical time complexity for SGD methods (continuous): O(n^nan)

The theoretical expectation that SGD methods scale better than standard methods is ❌ not confirmed by the empirical results for binary treatment.

The theoretical expectation that SGD methods scale better than standard methods is ❌ not confirmed by the empirical results for continuous treatment.

This analysis confirms the professor's hypothesis that stochastic methods, particularly when combined with batching, offer significant advantages for large-scale causal inference tasks.
